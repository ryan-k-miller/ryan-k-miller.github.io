# Machine Learning Algorithms
Implementations of popular machine learning algorithms using Python, including:
### Deep Learning
- [Artificial Neural Network](https://github.com/ryan-k-miller/Machine-Learning-Algorithms/blob/master/Neural%20Network/NeuralNetwork.py)  

### Classification
- [Decision Tree](https://github.com/ryan-k-miller/Machine-Learning-Algorithms/blob/master/Decision_Tree.ipynb)  
- [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/ryan-k-miller/Machine-Learning-Algorithms/blob/master/LogisticRegression.py)  
- [Random Forest](https://github.com/ryan-k-miller/Machine-Learning-Algorithms/blob/master/Random_Forest_Classifier)  

### Clustering
- [Gaussian Mixture Model](https://github.com/ryan-k-miller/Machine-Learning-Algorithms/blob/master/Gaussian_Mixture_Model.ipynb)  
- [K-Means](https://github.com/ryan-k-miller/Machine-Learning-Algorithms/blob/master/K_Means.ipynb)  
  
Each implementation, except for the ANN and clustering algorithms, includes a comparison to its sklearn equivalent using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. The clustering algorithms are used to segment the RGB values of an image, and the artificial neural network is trained and tested on the MNIST dataset.

For the Jupyter Notebooks, you can see the example and the comparison here on Github. For the python scripts, you can run the examples by downloading the scripts and running them in your preferred IDE or through the command line.
