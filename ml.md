# Machine Learning Algorithms
Implementations of popular machine learning algorithms using Python, including:
- Artificial Neural Network (using Fully Connected layers)
- Decision Tree (using information gain)
- Random Forest (using bagging and the above implementation of the Decision Tree algorithm)
- Logistic Regression (using l2 regularization and gradient descent)
- Gaussian Mixture Model (using Expectation Maximization)
- K-Means
  
Each implementation, except for the ANN and clustering algorithms, includes a comparison to its sklearn equivalent using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. The clustering algorithms are used to segment the RGB values of an image, and the artificial neural network is trained and tested on the MNIST dataset.

For the Jupyter Notebooks, you can see the example and the comparison here on Github. For the python scripts, you can run the examples by downloading the scripts and running them in your preferred IDE or through the command line.
